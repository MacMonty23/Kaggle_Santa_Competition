# Kaggle_Santa_Competition
The code created for the Kaggle Stanta competition. It is based on the Metropolis algorythm in a simulated annealing setting, which
allows for one way changes in family positions and swaps between families. A 2 day simulation results in a circa 72k cost result, which puts it in the upper half of the solutions provided to the competition. For more information please check Kaggle Santa competition and the information provided there.
